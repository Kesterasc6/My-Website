            My favorite thing to do on my free time is play videogames.
            My favorite game that I had played was Dark Souls 3.
            Dark Souls III is an action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. 
            An entry in the Souls series, Dark Souls III was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide in April 2016.

            Dark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark.
            You play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones at Firelink Shrine in order to link the flame again. 
            The protagonist is known as an "Unkindled," a kind of Undead, although it is never fully ennunciated upon what differentiates an Unkindled from other Undead. 
            There are implications that an Unkindled is the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link the flame and, as a result, burned their bodies into ash.
            The five Lords of Cinder were the reclusive lord of the Profaned Capital.
