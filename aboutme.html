          I was born on September 10,2002 and had lived in philidelphia for four to five years.
          Later I had moved to New York where I had attended Elementary School and it was called
          P.S.95Q. After graduating I went to Holy Family Cathlioc Academy and learned that I was 
          interested in the Computer Science field. After graduating from my middle school I am 
          attending Hillcrest High School where I am currently taking a Computer Science course to better
          my comprehension .
